# Coding Dock

## Description 
An application for freelance Web Coders to search for gigs based on their coding language. From the homepage, the users will either login with previously entered credentials or signup to create a profile and access jobs. The user will be able to select the language for which jobs are available. Once language is selected, all jobs pertaining to desired language will populate. The user will be able to view the job card which will contain information on what a potential client needs and how much that particular project is paying. If the user decides to take on that project, they will be able to click "contact" at the bottom of the card which will then bring up the clients contact information.
